# Hi :dizzy:
I’m **Kacper**, and I am a Computer Science student passionate about working on practical project and exploring data-driven research. I am keen on data analysis and visualization, as well as the development of interactive games and useful web applications. In my free time I focus on learning languages and making music.

## 👥 Group Projects

### [🌍 PlanetThere 📆](https://github.com/Bouchene-Mehdi/PlanetThere)
A dynamic web platform. Developed for Web Development module at ISEP Paris. Made for event creators and attendees. MVC architecture built with native HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. Features:
* Advanced event search, registration & reviews.
* Creator dashboard for event CRUD & templates for event scheduling.
* Admin tools for user/event moderation & FAQ management.

### [🐵 Concrete Jumple 🎮](https://github.com/kjanus03/concrete-jumple)
A 2D speed-running platformer in Java (JavaFX + FXGL). Developed for Software Engineering module at ISEP Paris. It features procedurally generated levels, chasing enemies, buffs, and a leaderboard.
  * Enemies chase & stun the player; three buffs (speed, jump, invincibility).
  * MongoDB leaderboard for storing the best times.
  * Adjustable volume and resolution.
  * All sprites and music are custom made!

### [🕸️ OLX Scraper 📄](https://github.com/kjanus03/olx-scrapper)
A self-initiated Python (PyQt5) desktop app for scraping OLX based on user queries.
* Define and manage custom search queries; async scraping via aiohttp.
* Sortable table view with export to CSV/Excel/JSON/XML and history logs.
* Configurable settings (page limits, GUI size) and Dark Mode toggle.

### [🔭 Sky Session Planner 📅](https://github.com/kjanus03/star-session-planner)
A passion project Flask web app (Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS)  for planning stargazing sessions in user-picked locations based on various conditions. Uses several APIs.
* Integrates OpenStreetMap & OpenElevation for site data.
* Fetches weather from Open-Meteo and computes celestial events with Skyfield.
* Works for any geographic location on Earth.

## 🔬 Personal Research Projects

### [🎶 Spotify Skipping Classifier ❌](https://github.com/kjanus03/spotify-skipping-classification) alongside the [Report](https://github.com/kjanus03/spotify-skipping-classification/blob/master/raport_kacper_janus_3.pdf)
ML model (pandas, scikit-learn) predicting when a user will skip a track based on streaming history and song features.
* Processes Spotify streaming history into features alongside extracting my own features used for furhter research.
* Uses ML pipelines (ColumnTransformer, scaling, one-hot encoding) with DecisionTree, RandomForest, and SVM models.
* Implements under-/over-sampling and outlier removal to handle imbalanced data.

### [✈️ Plane Direction Detector 🧭](https://github.com/kjanus03/plane-direction-detector)
Computer vision project (PyTorch) to detect airplanes in images and classify their flight heading using a neural network.
  * In construction!
